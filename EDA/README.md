The Following folder contains code with Exploratory Data Analysis. Key findings are summarized as follows:
  - There is data imbalance (Upsampling/SMOTe will need to be employed)
  - Due to high dimensionality and less data, DR will need to be used
  - Most features are not highly correlated. Hence, t-SNE or U-MAP would also be explored.
  - There are no missing values in the dataset.
  - Pairwise plots also show skewed distributions in the dataset. Hence, non-linear supervised learning methods will be used for modelling.
